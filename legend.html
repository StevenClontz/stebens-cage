<B>I used to be an average kid... until I moved to my new hometown; I was
walking home from school on the first day of school when a truck crashed
and spilt this strange chemical on me: GC1-61. &nbsp;Now I have these strange
powers. &nbsp;I know the plant is out to get me and turn me into some experiment,
but I guess I'm not so average anymore... wait... Crap! &nbsp;That's the
Alex Mack legend!!! My story is one day a teacher put out a sheet of paper
with the A-honor roll students on it. &nbsp;It had a screwed up font; all
the "v"s turn into "b"s. &nbsp;The reason I live in a cage is that the US
Secret Service realized I was too smart; with my intelligence I could take
the country over! &nbsp;Of course I could. &nbsp;Now my ambitions are to
take over the world and wreak my vengence upon those that locked me up in
the cage! (cue malevolent and hysterical laughter) &nbsp;Ha! Ha ha! &nbsp;Ha
ha ha!!!&nbsp;Of course, I'll have the help of my leetle pets... heh,
heh...</B>
