SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR AOL USERS
We have discovered that the customized browser associated with
AOL does not fully support Homestead SiteBuilder.  In order to
access Homestead, please use your AOL account as your Internet
connection but use a browser on your local computer (as opposed
to AOL's browser) in order to see your account and your Web
sites.  Here's how:
1. Login to AOL.
2. Reduce the AOL window by clicking on the button with the
   underscore (_) in the upper right hand corner of the AOL
   window.
3. Open Internet Explorer by double-clicking the desktop icon.
   (If you do not see the IE icon on your desktop, click on the
   'Start' button in the lower left corner of your screen. Then,
   select 'Programs.' Within 'Programs', look for Internet Explorer.
4. Once you have opened the IE browser window, login to your
   Homestead account.
