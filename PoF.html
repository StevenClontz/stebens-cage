<B>This and its fellow new card, Hundredtales, have a new type. &nbsp;Pikachu
on Fire's type is Disco-Type Pok&eacute;mon. &nbsp;Instead of the normal
Pikachu's "Mouse Pok&eacute;mon" status, the new Pikachu on Fire has is a
"Groovy Pok&eacute;mon." &nbsp;It's height and weight are the same, but its
attacks are totally different. &nbsp;The Sing attack causes major damage;
only enormously strong Pok&eacute;mon like Charizard and Vileplume can withstand
such an attack. &nbsp;On the bright side, the Pok&eacute;mon affected can
never be put to sleep anymore as long as it's in play. &nbsp;An even more
revolutionary attack is the Burn Baby Burn attack; it automatically Knocks
Out the defending Pok&eacute;mon. &nbsp;Apparently the new Pikachu kept its
old form's number, but the discription's totally changed. It now reads "When
this Pok&eacute;mon is cornered, it sings and scares away the other
Pok&eacute;mon." &nbsp;It's attacks and retreat use Disco-Type energy, a
form of energy not yet created. &nbsp;Wizards of the Coast is planning to
release a Rainbow-Type energy card which lets a Pok&eacute;mon have one energy
of any type in exchange for losing 10 HP. &nbsp;A Ditto could also use the
attacks. &nbsp;This and the Hundredtales cards are the only cards by Wizards
of the Coast to use any type of energy besides Colorless. &nbsp;The Weakness
is another new type; no one has decided what it is, thought many experts
believe it is supposed to be a "Nineties"-Type energy, but no one knows for
sure. &nbsp;Only time will tell.</B>
