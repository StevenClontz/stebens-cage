<FONT COLOR="White"><B>This and its fellow new card, Pikachu on Fire, have
a new type. &nbsp;Hundredtale's type is Strange-Type Pok&eacute;mon.
&nbsp;Instead of the normal Ninetale's status, the new Hundredtales has is
a "Freak Pok&eacute;mon." &nbsp;It's height, weight, and attacks are totally
different. &nbsp;So far, the Tail Whip attack does no damage according to
the official rules of Pok&eacute;mon TCG, but maybe the next revision will
change that. &nbsp;Smokin' doesn't do much damage, but does poison the Defending
Pok&eacute;mon. What's strange about the attack is that it also is supposed
to make the Defending Pok&eacute;mon "Stupid." Again, the next revision of
the rules will probably have an affect on what that does. &nbsp;The new
Hundredtales totally changed its number and description. It is the number
123.4, which isn't in MY Pok&eacute;dex! &nbsp;It's description is short
and sweet: "This Pok&eacute;mon is a freak of nature." I'd have to agree.
&nbsp;It's attacks and retreat use Strange-Type energy, a form of energy
not yet created. &nbsp;Wizards of the Coast is planning to release a Rainbow-Type
energy card which lets a Pok&eacute;mon have one energy of any type in exchange
for losing 10 HP. &nbsp;A Ditto could also use the attacks. &nbsp;This and
the Pikachu on Fire cards are the only cards by Wizards of the Coast to use
any type of energy besides Colorless. &nbsp;The Weakness is supposed to be
a pair of sissors; I don't know about you, but if I had a hundred tales,
I wouldn't want anybody snipping them off. &nbsp;It has the greatest number
of HP in any Pok&eacute;mon TCG card yet, rivaling the Jungle card Vileplume
(120 HP). &nbsp;It evolves from what looks like a Vulpix, but has over ten
tales. &nbsp;Maybe this strange Pok&eacute;mon evolves from Ninetales in
the Gold/Silver versions of Pok&eacute;mon (the video game). &nbsp;I guess
we'll find out in Sept. of 2000.</B></FONT>
