<B><I>Hello, this is Bob The Hobo. I haven&#146;t updated my commentaries
because, frankly, I don&#146;t care. But, today I&#146;m bored, so I thought
I would tell you the story behind InstaBrent.I am exposing him for the cheap
copier that he is.</I></B>

<B><I>First off, if you read through his commentaries you will find a reference
to Waffle Man. The reference to him says he was defeated by the (villains
name).If you have every seen Mystery Men (the movie) you would see that he
is a character in the movie.</I></B>

<B><I>Last, InstaBrent makes a reference to Pinky The Wonder Hamster. This
is just a cheap imitation of Harvey The Wonder Hamster (Weird Al Yankovic&#146;s
Pet Hamster).</I></B>
